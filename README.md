# Mastermind
## What is it?
It is a console version of the game Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs). Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space. Check it out on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game). You can choose to be the codebreaker or the codemaker.
